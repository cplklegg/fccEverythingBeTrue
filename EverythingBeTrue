Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).

Remember, you can access object properties through either dot notation or [] notation.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

code:

function truthCheck(collection, pre) {
  
  var count = 0;
  // Check for each object
  for (var x in collection) {
    // If it is has property and value is truthy
    if (collection[x].hasOwnProperty(pre) && Boolean(collection[x][pre])) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  // Outside the loop, check to see if we got true for all of them and return true or false
  return count == collection.length;
}
